For this project, I didn’t write the code myself. Instead, I used AI to generate it and focused on understanding what it was doing. Watching how the AI built the Bag class helped me see how different parts of Java fit together in a real example.

I learned how a class can implement an interface and use another data structure inside it. Seeing the AI use an ArrayList showed me how delegation works and why it is better to use existing code instead of starting from scratch.

Generics started to make sense once I saw how the AI used <E> to make the Bag class work with any type of object. The iterator part was also interesting because I could finally see how Java goes through a collection one element at a time using hasNext() and next().

The AI also generated unit tests, and reading through them helped me understand how testing works. I learned what it means to test edge cases and how tests can prove that the program works as intended.

Even though I didn’t write the code myself, I still learned a lot from studying it. The project showed me how an AI can build working, well-structured code, and it helped me understand the logic behind what it created.
